Tests if Spring Data JDBC with HikariCP is working.

== Lifecycle configuration guidance

Non-embedded databases require extra configuration to avoid Hibernate to contact the remote database before the refresh phase:

```
# Specify explicitly the dialect (here for PostgreSQL, adapt for your database)
# Supported as of Spring Boot 3.3
spring.data.jdbc.dialect=postgresql

# Database initialization should typically be performed outside of Spring lifecycle
spring.sql.init.mode=never
```

=== CRaC

In order to allow checkpoint/restore to work as expected, Hikari pool suspension should be enabled:

```
spring.datasource.hikari.allow-pool-suspension=true
```
